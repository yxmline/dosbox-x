README for DOSBox-X DOS version
===============================

Welcome to DOSBox-X, a cross-platform DOS emulator based on the DOSBox project.

This is a special DOSBox-X version for use in a real DOS system. Not all features supported in other platforms can be supported in this version.

Simply run DOSBOX-X.EXE in MS-DOS or compatible to start DOSBox-X, as all required HX DOS Extender files are already included in the package.

If you want to enable long filename support, before running DOSBox-X you also need to load the (freely available) DOSLFN driver and then start DOSBox-X with "DOSBOX-X -SET LFN=1".

For more information about DOSBox-X, including usage tips and common ways to configure DOSBox-X, please read the online user guide in the DOSBox-X Wiki:
