Welcome to DOSBox-X, a cross-platform DOS emulater based on the DOSBox project.

Note:

Due to the way of how Windows works, access to the 'Program Files' folder requires administrative permissions. Unless you have specific reasons, we recommend that you install DOSBox-X in a different folder that does not require administrative permissions.
