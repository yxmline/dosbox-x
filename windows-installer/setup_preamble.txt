Welcome to DOSBox-X, a cross-platform DOS emulater based on the DOSBox project.

Like DOSBox, it emulates a PC necessary for running many MS-DOS games and applications that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems. However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this. Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows.

Note:

Due to the way of how Windows works, access to the 'Program Files' folder requires administrative permissions. Unless you have specific reasons, we recommend that you install DOSBox-X in a different folder that does not require administrative permissions.
